# esptool

A cute Python utility to communicate with the ROM bootloader in Espressif ESP8266.
It is intended to be a simple, platform independent, open source replacement for XTCOM.

This is work in progress, batteries are not yet included.

## Usage

This utility does not have a user interface yet. Hack it, like real hackers! ;)

## Protocol

The bootloader protocol uses [SLIP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLIP) framing.
Each packet is begin and end with `0xC0`, all occurrences of `0xC0` and `0xDB` inside the packet
are replaced with `0xDB 0xDC` and `0xDB 0xDD`, respectively.

Inside the framing, the packet consists of a header and a variable-length body.

### Request

Byte   | Name		| Comment
-------|----------------|-------------------------------
0      | Direction	| Always `0x00` for requests
1      | Command	| Requested operation, according to separate table
2-3    | Size		| Size of body
4-7    | Checksum	| XOR checksum of payload, only used in block transfer packets
8..n   | Body		| Depends on operation

### Response

Byte   | Name		| Comment
-------|----------------|-------------------------------
0      | Direction	| Always `0x01` for responses
1      | Command	| Same value as in the request packet that trigged the response
2-3    | Size		| Size of body
4-7    | Value		| Response data for some operations
8..n   | Body		| Depends on operation

### Opcodes

Byte   | Name			| Comment
-------|------------------------|-----------------------
`0x02` | Flash Download Start	|
`0x03` | Flash Download Data	|
`0x04` | Flash Download Finish	|
`0x05` | RAM Download Start	|
`0x06` | RAM Download Finish	|
`0x07` | RAM Download Data	|
`0x08` | Sync Frame		|
`0x09` | Write register		|
`0x0a` | Read register		|

### Checksum
Each byte in the payload is XOR'ed together, as well as the magic number `0xEF`.
The result is stored as a zero-padded byte in the 32-bit checksum field in the header.
